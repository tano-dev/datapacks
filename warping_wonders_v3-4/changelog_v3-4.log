## Changes:
- Waypoint Hub Menu entries now show the selected Head Icon from the block *(shows owners head until Icon was changed for already placed onces)*
- Added admin tag. Can be used by admins to modify or tp to any waypoint. Can be set with `/tag <playername> add wawo.admin`; will also autmatically be assigned when openening the admin config mennu via `/function warping_wonders`
- Changed item which is used to add/change Waypoint Lore to Book (was Paper)
- Waypoint Menus no longer show the current Waypoint in the list
- Using a renamed Paper on a Waypoint now can grant players permission to teleport to it regardless of it being locked or not:
    - Text keys to grant permission `trust <playername>` or `Trust <playername>`
    - Text keys to revoke permission `untrust <playername>` or `Untrust <playername>`
- Waypoints now show their access status in the Menu:
    - **Public**: available for everyone
    - **Private**: only the owner (and admins) can teleport to it
    - **List of Names**: additional players that can teleport to the Waypoint if it's locked

## Fixes:
- Mounts and Pets not being teleported to Waypoints in certain situations
